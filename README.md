# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on heart disease. Leveraging the power of scikit-learn and other Python libraries, particularly in the Google Colab environment, I explore and analyze heart disease-related data. The main highlight is the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features.

# Technologies Used:

- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab for a collaborative and interactive environment

# Key Steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Exploring and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Utilizing Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for insightful visualizations.
- Model Development: Implementing a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance.
- Collaboration: Developed in Google Colab for easy sharing and collaborative work.


Feel free to explore, contribute, and use the code for your own projects!
